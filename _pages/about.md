I'm a research engineer in the R&D department at a Japanese company.

My focus is on developing algorithms and systems that help people bring their ideas to life. Currently, I am working on creating a new skill for [aibo](https://us.aibo.com/), Sony's pet robot, developing a reinforcement learning library called [nnablaRL](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-rl), and applying reinforcement learning to various services and products.

For my master's degree, I researched human-following robots.
In my PhD, I am working on developing a human-friendly telemanipulation system. You can find more details on my [CV](https://shunichi09.github.io/cv/) page and [Publications](https://shunichi09.github.io/publications/).
