I'm a research engineer in the research and development department at a Japanese company.

I'm interested in developing algorithms and systems that assist people who would like to realize their ideas.
Currently, I'm working on a behavior learning project for realizing a robot being able to manipulate objects and developing a reinforcement learning library, called [nnablaRL](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-rl).

I researched a human-following robot at university. See [CV](https://shunichi09.github.io/cv/) page and [Publications](https://shunichi09.github.io/publications/) section to get more information, if you're interested.

Recently, I've started to learn 3D CG creations. See [Portfolio](https://shunichi09.github.io/portfolio/)
